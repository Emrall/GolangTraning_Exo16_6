Find a problem at projecteuler.net then create the solution. Add a comment beneath your solution that includes a description of the problem. Upload your solution to github. Tweet me a link to your solution. 

### Problem select at projecteuler.net :
https://projecteuler.net/problem=37 <br/>
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, 
and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.
NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
